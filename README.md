# EtchASketch

Simple Etch-A-Sketch game with 3 game modes. Classic mode simply colors the blocks black. The progressive darkening mode colors the blocks on a scale from white to black where repeated coloring makes the block darker. It takes 10 iterations to color a block fully black. Random mode generates a random color to fill the block with. The game was made solely from HTML, CSS and Javascript.
